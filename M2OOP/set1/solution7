7.	What is wrong in this program? If there is any problem with the below code, provide the corrected code.
class Human
{
public:
    Human() {}
    ~ Human(){}
};
class Pilot: public Human
{
public:
    Pilot():Human(){}
    ~ Pilot(){}
};
int main(void)
{
  Human* george = new Pilot();
  delete george;
}


The Desrtructors are called as derived class destructor  first and then the base class destructor.
In this the object of the base class is assigned to the derived class and the object is deleted.
So, the base class destructor is called and not derived class destrutor.
To avoid this virtual keyword is used.
class Human
{
public:
    Human() {}
   virtual ~ Human(){}
};

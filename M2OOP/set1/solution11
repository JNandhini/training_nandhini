11.	Why does this example work on UNIX, but when we run it in
MSDOS/Windows we get the message:
oot
ew able: file not found

#ifndef __MSDOS_
#define NAME "/root/new/table"
#else __MSDOS_
#define NAME "\root\new\table"
#endif __MSDOS_
in_file.open(NAME);
if (in_file.bad) {
cout << NAME << ": file not found\n";
exit (8);
}

Output:

In MSDOS and windows the \r-root,\n- newline,\t-tab  and uses backslash .
#else __MSDOS_
#define NAME "\root\new\table" in this the \r  is taken and prints oot.
  \n as new line and prints as ew then \t as  tab and prints the able

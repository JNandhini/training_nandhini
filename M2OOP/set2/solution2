2.	Explain abstraction for the following example: Implementation not required. 
You have an object Mobile Phone and have 3 mobile phones as following:-
N 142 (Features:- Calling, SMS)
N 271 (Features:- Calling, SMS, FM Radio, MP3, Camera)
B (Features:-Calling, SMS, FM Radio, MP3, Camera, Video Recording, Reading E-mails)
(Example could be in JAVA or C++)


Answer:
 
 Abstraction:
 Abstraction is used to hide the functionality that goes beyond some action.It shows only the implementation part of the action.
 For example phone has many option and if the user needs swipe the phone screen then only the swipe is shown to the user but the functionality behind that.
 
class N142
{
//data member
protected:
void calling();
void sms();
};
class N271:protected N142
{
//data member
protected:
void FM_Radio();
void Mp3();
void camera();
};
class B:protected N271
{
//data member
protected:
void video_recording();
void reading_emails();
}

In this the concept of inheritance is used.The access specifier used is protected because it show the functionality to the derived class ad hides from outside class
Three classes with some function like calling,sms are defined.The derived class  gets the functionality.

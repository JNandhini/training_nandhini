13.	The following program generates the answer 47 instead of the expected answer 144. Why?
#include <iostream.h>
#define FIRST_PART 7
#define LAST_PART 5
#define ALL_PARTS FIRST_PART + LAST_PART
main()
{
cout << "The square of all the parts is " <<
ALL_PARTS * ALL_PARTS << '\n';
return (0);
}

Answer:

The value taken by the function is like
7+5*7+5 
=7+35+5
47

* has first priority so it multiplies and then add the value.
and if bracket is provided as 
ALL_PARTS (FIRST_PART + LAST_PART)
 then (7+5)
 as 12
 12*12
 144

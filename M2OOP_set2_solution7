7.	A CustomVector class is defined as follows: 
class CustomVector {
 public: 
// constructors and other public interface goes here 
private: 
// private data 
std::vector< double> elements; 
int length; 
};

(a) Design and code three constructors: 
(i) a constructor: that takes a single integer that indicates the size of vector; 
(ii) a constructor: that takes a length integer and an array of doubles to initialise the values; 
(iii) a copy constructor. 
(b) Give a example usage of each. 
(c) Explain the problem that would arise if we used dynamic memory allocation (C++-style new or C-style malloc) instead of using std::vector<> 
(d) What mechanism shall be used to overcome the problems arising in part (c)?
(e) For CustomVector class, show how the square brackets operator (indexing operator) can be overloaded to return a given indexed element. Should this operator be a class member function, and if so will it be private or public


class CustomVector {
 public: 
CustomVector
{
}
private: 
// private data 
std::vector< double> elements; 
int length; 
};

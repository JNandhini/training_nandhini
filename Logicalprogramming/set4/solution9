9.	How will you change the program to print ch as int?
#include <iostream.h>
signed char ch; // Very short integer
// Range is -128 to 127
int main()
{
ch = 37;
cout << "The number is " << ch << '\n';
return (0);
}

Answer:
Typecasting should be done to print the value as 37.
cout << "The number is " << int(ch) << '\n';

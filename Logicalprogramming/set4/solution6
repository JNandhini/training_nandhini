Auto
Auto is the default storage classes. It's scope is inside the function and cannot accessed outside the function it declared.
It is used as local variables.

Syntax:
datatype  identifier;
or
auto datatype identifier;

Register:

Register is a temporary memory which is used to store the value temporarily. It also like auto because it's scope is within the function.
The values are stored in register and not in primary memory.This helps to increase the processing speed.

Syntax:

regiter datatype identifier;

Static

Static has the lifetime  for the whole program.The static variable holds the previous value and can be used.
The variable is allocated when program is started and deallocated wwhen the program ends.

Syntax:

static datatype identifier;

Extern:

Extern is a global variable.If it is initialized then the value cannot be changed.

17.	What does the above program output? (Try running it on your machine.). Why did it output what it did? (Try checking the output of the preprocessor.)

#include <iostream.h>
#define SQR(x) ((x) * (x))
main ()
{
int counter; /* Counter for loop */
counter = 0;
while (counter < 5)
cout << "x << counter + 1 <<
" x squared" << SQR(++counter) << '\n';
return (0);
}
Why does this not produce the expected output? How much does the counter go up each time.


Answer:

x3 x squared4
x5 x squared16
x7 x squared36

counter value is added by 2

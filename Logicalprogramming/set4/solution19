19.	In the following program, the HIGH_SPEED flag works, but the DIRECT_CONNECT flag does not. Why?
#include <iostream.h>
const int HIGH_SPEED = (1<<7); /* modem is running fast */
// we are using a hardwired connection
const int DIRECT_CONNECT = (1<<8);
char flags = 0; // start with nothing
main()
{
flags |= HIGH_SPEED; // we are running fast
flags |= DIRECT_CONNECT; // because we are wired together
if ((flags & HIGH_SPEED) != 0)
cout <<"High speed set\n";
if ((flags & DIRECT_CONNECT) != 0)
cout <<"Direct connect set\n";
return (0);
}


Answer:

In binary 
the value of flag is 0000 0000
The value of HIGH_SPEED is 1000 0000
flag|= High_SPEED;
=1000 0000 
flag is of char stores 8 bit
the value of DIRECT_CONNECT is 0001 0000 0000
flag|= DIRECT_CONNECT;
=0000 0000;
it exceeds the range of char.
so the DIRECT_CONNECT is not set

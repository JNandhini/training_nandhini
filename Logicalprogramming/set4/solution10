10.	For some strange reason, the program here thinks that everyone owes a balance of O dollars. Why?

#include <iostream.h>
int balance_owed; // amount owed
main ()
{
cout << "Enter number of dollars owed:";
cin >> balance_owed;
if (balance_owed = 0)
cout << "You owe nothing.\n";
else
cout << "You owe " << balance_owed << " dollars.\n";
return (0);
}
Sample output:
Enter number of dollars owed: 12
You owe 0 dollars.

ANSWER:

if (balance_owed = 0) 
Here the equality operator(==) should be used to check the condition else it will assign the value as 0 to the balance_owed.
if (balance_owed == 0) is the correct expression.

20.	In Example the first loop works, but the second fails. Why?
#include <iostream.h>
main ()
{
short int i;
// Works
for (i = 0x80; i !=0; i = (i >> 1)) {
cout << "i is " << hex << i << dec << '\n';
}
signed char ch;
// Fails
for (ch = 0x80; ch!=0; ch = (ch >> 1))
cout << "ch is " << hex << int(ch) << dec << '\n';
}
return (0);
}


Answer:

ch is char variable 
It stores only 8 bit.
0x80 is 1000 0000
it is right shifted until the condition fails
0x1 is 0000 0001
when it is right shifted it is in negative value
So make the signed char to unsigned char.

2.	Why does this program print ''The value of 1/3 is 0"? What must be done to this
program to fix it?
#include <iostream.h>
float answer; // the result of the divide
main ()
{
answer = 1/3;
cout << "The value of 1/3 is " << answer << "\n";
return (0);
}


Answer:
The value 1/3 is declared as float but the compiler treats it as an integer and gives the result as 0.
If the value is given in float as 1.0/3.0 then the result is 0.333333.

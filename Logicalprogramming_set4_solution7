7.	Why does the following program fail to print the correct zip code? What does
it print instead?
long int zip; // Zip code
main()
{
zip = 02137L; // Use the zip code for Cambridge MA
cout << "New York's zip code is: " << zip << '\n';
return(0);
}


Answer:

02137 is an octal value .Normally a compiler prints the decimal value for every value.
The octal value is converted to decimal value. The value printed is 1119 which is a decimal value.

1.	The following will work on a UNIX machine but will fail on a PC
int zip; // zip code for current address
........
zip = 92126;
Why does this fail? What will be the result when run on a PC?

Answer:
The range of integer is from -32768 to 32767 in normal compiler.So this fails to print the value of integer and prints the address of the value.

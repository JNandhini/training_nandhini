System Design

 

Documentation Standards:

 

1. The software HANGMAN version 1.0
contains standard module headers and the comment statements for the headers are
given as per required. The headers for socket communication and some external
library include comment statements. The ratio of the comment statements for the
header is three headers for one line of commentary. The difficult area like
server side connections and client side connections are given comment statements
literally line by line. The less difficult areas like drawing some images like
circle, creating windows and querying database are commented on the ratio of fives
lines of code to one line comment statement.

 

 

Naming conventions:

 

1.
The naming conventions used in the system
is camel case and underscores are used to separate two or more words.

 




 
  
  File types
   
  
  
  File Extensions
   
  
 
 
  
  Header file
  
  
  .h
   
  
 
 
  
  Class file
  
  
  .cpp
   
  
 
 
  
  Database file
   
  
  
  .sql
  
 




 

 

2. The naming conventions used for files, programs,
modules are camel case. The naming conventions used for variables are camel case.
The functions names are given using small letters with underscore in between two
words. In database the naming conventions used for 

Database name and table names are camel
case.  

 

Programming Standards:

 

1. The languages used in the system are c++ and sql.
The sql means structured query language. It is an efficient language which is
used to communicate with the database to store and retrieve details from the
database. It provides an easy way to manipulate all the records in the
database. C++ is a portable and efficient language which is an object oriented programming
language. In this system c++ is used for coding socket communication, client
side user interface, and every part of coding.

 

2.
The language used for database querying
is sql and other coding in c++. The sql language is not case sensitive and the
query is like.

 Example:
To insert new row

 

 insert
into tablename(column name1,column name2) values('value1','value2');

 

c++ language standards used in the
system are

 

For classes:

 

class ClassName

{

coding;

};

 

 

  For
functions:

 

returntype  function_name()

{

coding;

}

 

For loops and statements:

 

for(condition;)

{

coding;

}

 

if(condition)

{

statements;

}

 

For variables:

 

Returntype VariableName1;

Returntype VariableName2;

 

 

3. Ths system includes the programming
standards in consistent and uniform programming style.

 

            a.Modularity
defines the term that the design is split into several modules that can be
independently created. In the system modules created are accessed through the
interfaces.

            b.
the programming standards for headers and commenting are

         


              For headers

 

            #include <library.h>

            #include
"header.h"

            #include
<library>

   


            For
commenting

 

            //The
comments are

 

            c.indenting
and layout standards are

             

Indenting

 

                             for
class

                                     no space from margin

                                    

     for
functions:

single tab

                                    

                            


     for variables:

                                    single
 tab

                        

                        for
looping and statements:

                                    double
tab

 

            d.
The library routines used are

            

                        for graphics programming using  c++

                        

bgi

            

                        for socket communication using c++

 

libws2_32.a

                                                          

            e. language constructs to be used
are

                        for programmming in c++

                              class ClassName

                                   {

                                    Variable declaration;

                                    Function definition;

                                    };

              f. Language constructs to avoid

                          for c++

                                class
classname{

                                    Variable declaration;

                                    Function definition; }; 

    

SOFTWARE
 DEVELOPEMENT TOOLS

          

          1. The
development tools used for creating an application is visual studio 2013.The
tool used for creating user interface, establishing server connection between
client and server is visual studio 2013.

           2. The lists includes the tools used for
application development tool, tool for documentation.

                     a. visual studio 2013- for
developing application

                      b. Microsoft word 2010-
used for documentation

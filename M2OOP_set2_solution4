4.	A group of  geometric figures have a position and an orientation in a three dimensional space, and a function to draw themself. 
The geometric objects are: Point, Line, Plane, Cube, Cuboid. 
Implementation not required
(a) Draw a likely class hierarchy.
(b) Write the base class with required attributes and methods.
(c) Explain why, by using a base class and hierarchy, the process of including a new
subclass, such as a Ellipsoid, is impressively easy.

Answer:
a.hierarchy 
      
       Class    geometric

  /       \   \   \     \    \
class class class class class class 
point line  plane cube  cuboid ellipsoid
b. base class attribute and methods
 
 class geometric
 {
 public:
 string orientation;
 public:
 void  dimension()
 {
 int xaxis;
 int yaxis;
 int zaxis;
 }
 virtual void draw();
 {
 //code
 }
 };
 
 C.why easy for ellipsoid
 
 because the properties of the base class are inherited to the derived class ellipsoid,so it is not necessary to define the method.

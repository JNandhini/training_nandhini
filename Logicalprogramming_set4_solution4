4.	Why does the following program print incorrect answers?

#include <iostream.h>
int array[3][5] = { // Two dimensional array
{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 },
{10, 11, 12, 13, 14 },
{20, 21, 22, 23, 24 }
};
main()
{
cout << "Last element is " << array[2,4] << '\n';
return (0);
}

Answer:

The array index value represents to the memory location of the value. array[2,4] is not the correct form to print the value in the address.
array[2][4] should be used to get the correct value.
